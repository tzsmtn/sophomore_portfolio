    <!-- steps to craft the story -->
    <h2>‚úèÔ∏è Crafting Your Story ‚úèÔ∏è</h2>

    <img src="storytelling_process.png" alt="storytelling process">

    <p>Every great comic book begins with a compelling story. Your story is the foundation on which everything else will be built.</p>


    <ol>
      <li>Start by brainstorming ideas ‚Äî no thought is too small or too wild. Ask yourself:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>What kind of stories am I drawn to?</li>
        <li>What message do I want to convey?</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <li>From there, sketch out your plot.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Consider your beginning, middle, and end.</li>
        <li>Who are your heroes, and who opposes them?</li>
        <li>What challenges will they face, and how will they overcome them?</li>
      </ul>
    </ol>

    <p>Crafting a storyline involves weaving together characters, settings, and conflicts to create a narrative that's engaging and meaningful. Remember, the best stories are those that resonate with their readers, combining excitement with emotional depth.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Who are they?</li>
          <li>What makes them unique?</li>
          <li>Think about their appearance, abilities, and, most importantly, their personality.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Your character‚Äôs design should reflect their role in the story, from their costume to their expressions.</p>

    <p>Don't forget about your supporting cast ‚Äî friends, foes, and the characters in between. Each should have their distinct look and backstory, contributing to the richness of your world. As you design your characters, consider how their visual elements and backgrounds inform their motivations and development throughout the story.</p>
